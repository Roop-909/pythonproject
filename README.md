# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
Statisitcal Modelling with Python>
Getting data from three different APIs and conducting regressional analyses of the same

## Process
1. Data Collection and Preparation
2. Data Enrichment and Transformation
3. Data Integration
4. Visualization and Analysis
5. Interpretation and Conclusion



## Results
> Yelp API is more extensive in terms of data as compared to foursquare. But In my opinion Foursquare can give more relevant data. Foursquare is built for local social networking but YELP is more related to user reviews.
> The R-squared value of the model is 0.092, indicating that the model explains a limited amount of the variability in the data. The Adj. R-squared (Adj. RÂ²) is 0.064, suggesting that adding more relevant variables or exploring other factors may be necessary to improve the model's explanatory power. Additionally, the p-value of 0.0811 implies that the model is not highly statistically significant, indicating that "Shortest Yelp Distance from Station" may not be a strong predictor of the number of empty slots.
