# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
Statisitcal Modelling with Python>
Getting data from three different APIs and conducting regressional analyses of the same

## Process
1. Data Collection and Preparation
2. Data Enrichment and Transformation
3. Data Integration
4. Visualization and Analysis
5. Interpretation and Conclusion



## Results
> Yelp API is more extensive in terms of data as compared to foursquare. But In my opinion Foursquare can give more relevant data. Foursquare is built for local social networking but YELP is more related to user reviews.
